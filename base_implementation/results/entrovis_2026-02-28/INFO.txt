I took this at 28th February 2026 with these settings:
SAMPLE_RATE    = 44_100          # Hz
DURATION       = 10              # seconds  (10–30)
GRAIN_SIZE     = 2048            # samples per grain  (try 2048 too)
LSB_BITS       = 2               # how many LSBs to extract per sample (1 or 2)
CHANNELS       = 1               # mono

# Security Settings
WARMUP_SECONDS   = 1             # seconds to discard from start of recording
VAR_THRESHOLD    = 0.5           # min variance per grain to accept as entropy
MIN_UNIQUE_RATIO = 0.1           # min unique samples ratio per grain
AUTOCORR_THRESHOLD = 1         # max abs(lag-1 autocorrelation) to accept
