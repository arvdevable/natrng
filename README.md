# natrng
`natrng`, or Natural Random Number Generator, is a codebase for an academic paper titled "*Perancangan dan analisis penghasil angka acak berbasis suara lingkungan sekitar sebagai sumber entropi fisik.*".

For now, the codebase is a work in progress. The current codebase is just a simple base implementtion made in Python, but the goal is to create a more robust and efficient implementation in Rust.

For running base_implementation/main.py, you need to have Python installed. You can install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

```bash
pip install sounddevice numpy
python base_implementation/main.py
```
